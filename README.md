# pCCA-Hippocampus
Codes and Examples to apply partial canonical correlation analysis (pCCA) on neuronal population recordings. 
Papers applying this code: (doi:XXX; doi:YYY)

Two jupyter notebooks are provided showing: 1) pCCA on a Poission spiking network, 2) pCCA on real spiking data collected from CA3-CA1-RSC areas during novel maze learning on mice. 
The example recording can be downloaded from: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_bjB-ayoXiEEWIXPXC-S85_pmSjBUJ99/view?usp=drive_link

pCCA is implemented as a scikit-learn object. If no third recording is provided, then regular CCA is computed.
